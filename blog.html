        <p class="text-justify blog-paras my-1">In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules
            to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes
            shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An
            early example is an invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they
            thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice
            can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing,
            which converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and
            time.

            The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage.
            Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands,
            such as English or/and Spanish.

            One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written,
            is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or
            the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters, and numbers.
            Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.</p>

        <p class="text-justify blog-paras my-1">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an
            executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task.
            Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and
            resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly
            referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are
            intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing
            unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of
            a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.
            Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of
            the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance,
            implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer
            programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development
            is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual
            writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.
            Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts and programmers to understand and
            re-create/re-implement.[3]:3</p>

        <p class="text-justify blog-paras my-1">Computers and electronics play an enormous role in today's society,
            impacting everything from communication and medicine to science.

            Although computers are typically viewed as a modern invention involving electronics, computing predates
            the
            use of electrical devices. The ancient abacus was perhaps the first digital computing device. Analog
            computing dates back several millennia as primitive computing devices were used as early as the ancient
            Greeks and Romans, the most known complex of which being the Antikythera mechanism. Later devices such
            as
            the castle clock (1206), slide rule (c. 1624) and Babbage's Difference Engine (1822) are other examples
            of
            early mechanical analog computers.

            The introduction of electric power in the 19th century led to the rise of electrical and hybrid
            electro-mechanical devices to carry out both digital (Hollerith punch-card machine) and analog (Bush’s
            differential analyzer) calculation. Telephone switching came to be based on this technology, which led
            to
            the development of machines that we would recognize as early computers.</p>

        <p class="text-justify blog-paras my-1">
            The presentation of the Edison Effect in 1885 provided the theoretical background for electronic
            devices.
            Originally in the form of vacuum tubes, electronic components were rapidly integrated into electric
            devices,
            revolutionizing radio and later television. It was in computers however, where the full impact of
            electronics was felt. Analog computers used to calculate ballistics were crucial to the outcome of World
            War
            II, and the Colossus and the ENIAC, the two earliest electronic digital computers, were developed during
            the
            war.

            With the invention of solid-state electronics, the transistor and ultimately the integrated circuit,
            computers would become much smaller and eventually affordable for the average consumer. Today
            “computers”
            are present in nearly every aspect of everyday life, from watches to automobiles.</p>
